# C-project
This project is the solution for scenario based question which is given by a trainer while training.

The project involves developing a program to Analyze the Costs and Profitability of different categories of products. In this project I used 3 category of products .The program allow for the analysis of different scenarios such as changes in sales value or increases in variable costs, in order to assess the impact on the profitability of each produced. It is developed using C programming language.

Question: Mr. X manufactures certain products and from the following information develop a program.
There is 3 category of product which are m, n, p.
The product m having the fixed cost of 15000, variable cost of 7000, semi variable cost of 4000 and sale is 22000.
The product n having the fixed cost of 15000, variable cost of 8000, semi variable cost of 6000 and sale is 8000.
The product p having the fixed cost of 15000, variable cost of 6000, semi variable cost of 5000 and sale is 3000.

1)What if the sales value of productivity increased in a percentage. (sales value)
2)Find product status of a product if the variable cost increased by a percentage. (production status=total cost(Fixed cost+ Variable cost+ Semi variable cost)-sale)
3)Break even of a product (No profit and No loss).
